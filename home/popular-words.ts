/*
In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text.

At the input of your function are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words the popularity of which you need to determine.

When solving this task pay attention to the following points:

The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.

Input:
    The text and the search words array.
Output:
    The dictionary where the search words are the keys and values are the number of times when those words are occurring in a given text.

Example:
    popularWords('When I was One \n\
    I had just begun\n\
    When I was Two\n\
    I was nearly new', ['i', 'was', 'three', 'near']) == {
        'i': 4,
        'was': 3,
        'three': 0,
        'near': 0
    }

function popularWords(text: string, words: string[]): {} {
    let obj = {};
    const arr = text.toLowerCase().split(/[\r\n ]/);
    words.forEach(w => {
        let count = 0;
        for (let elem of arr) {
            if (w === elem) count++
        }
        obj[w] = count;
    });
    return obj;
